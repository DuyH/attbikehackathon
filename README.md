### What?
'So You Think You Can Bike?' is an interactive web game to teach bicyclists and motorists alike the basic hand signals when riding a bicycle or even a motor vehicle. 

Submission for [AT&T Mobile App Hackathon, Seattle 2015]. The theme was "Bike Safety"

### Why?
Accidents often occur when there is miscommunication between cyclists and motorists. By using hand signals to make aware of a bicyclist's intentions, collisions between bikers and cars can be reduced. Learning these hand signals through repetition and fun, such as a video game, is a better way to engrain knowledge.
