What?
====
JavaScript engine for a "GuitarHero" like games. Uses D3js, backbone, and underscore. Less is used for compiling CSS.

Why?
====
We built a timeline platform for our [MoneyDesktop](http://www.moneydesktop.com/) goal platform. It looked similar to GuitarHero so I decided to make it a somewhat playable game engine.

Who?
====
Developed for [MoneyDesktop](http://www.moneydesktop.com/) initially by Dennis Wilkins ([@inlineblock](https://github.com/inlineblock)) and Josh Faul ([@jocafa](https://github.com/jocafa)).

How?
====
We utilize the browser, [D3](http://d3js.org/), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), and [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/). We are also utilizing [Less](http://lesscss.org/) so you don't need a server to process our stylesheets.

Wanna run it locally? Start up a HTTP server (required for less). A simple way on machines with python is to use SimpleHTTPServer.

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
